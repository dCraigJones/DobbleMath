# DobbleMath

Similar to the childen's card game [Spot It!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63268/spot-it) (originally released as _Dobble_ in UK), where each card has eight images and any pair of cards has exactly one match.  In **DobbleMath**, each card has several math problems and any pair of cards will have exactly two problems with the same solution.  The object of the game is to find the matching solutions!
